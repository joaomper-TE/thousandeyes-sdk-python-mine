This limited release includes endpoints that:  * Make our catalog provider and Internet outage data accessible to API users. * Provide access to advanced filtering, which is part of our next-generation API efforts to allow API users to fine-tune queries across all of our APIs in a consistent manner.  Internet Insights provide visibility into core Internet infrastructure, including ISPs, DNS providers, IaaS, CDNs , and SaaS providers.
