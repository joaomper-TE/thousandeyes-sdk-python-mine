    Test Template

     ## Overview  Test templates allow you create a set of tests, alert rules, dashboards, and labels from a single template configuration file.    The following applies to test templates:  * You can create tests for monitoring common services and applications such as Microsoft 365, Webex, and others using a predefined set of certified templates.  * Test templates reduce the time and complexity of creating tests for common SaaS or other services by providing a set of templates for creating tests, alert rules, and other assets within the ThousandEyes platform.  * Templates created with an account group in a particular organization are visible to all account groups in that organization, provided they have the `View Test Templates` permission.  * Credentials (usernames, passwords, tokens, etc.) can be included in a test template only as placeholders whose value is provided by user input when the template is deployed. Creating or updating a test template that contains a credentials field in plain text will result in a bad request (HTTP 400).  * The schemas to use for `labels`, `tests`, `alertRules` and `dashboards` are defined at https://developer.thousandeyes.com/v7/.  * To support referencing an asset from another asset of a different type (for example, defining the `testId` field of an `alertRule` by referencing the ID of a test defined in the template itself), the deployment of assets is done in a specific order:      1. Labels     2. Tests     3. Alert rules     4. Dashboards      For a given asset type, you can reference any asset type with a higher order. (For example, labels cannot reference other assets in the template; tests can only reference labels; alert rules can reference tests and labels, etc.)
